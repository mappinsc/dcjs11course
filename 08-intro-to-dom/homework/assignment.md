**99 Bottles of Beer**
- Remember the [99 Bottles of Beer assignment](../03-conditionals-and-loops#conclusion)? For this assignment, you'll be creating a website that programatically displays the lyrics to that song.
- You'll need to create both an `.html` file and a `.js` file
- In your HTML file, you'll want to have an unordered list (`<ul>`) that contains all of your lyrics
- Each line of the song should appear inside of a list item (`<li>`) within that unordered list
- Your JavaScript file should programatically append each line of the song to the page--no hard-coding lyrics in HTML!
